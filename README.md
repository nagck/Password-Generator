# Password Generator

## Description
Description: A password is randomly generated based on criteria that the user provides when prompted. 

In this repository ("Password Generator"), I have created an application (as part of my assignment for UofT SCS Coding Boot Camp Course) that you can use to generate a random password based on criteria the user provides when prompted. The application will run in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The user interface is responsive, and adapts to multiple screen sizes.

When a user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they are prompted to enter the desired  password length. If the entered number is outside the range of (8-128) characters, the user is prompted  once again to enter a password length within the range of (8-128) characters. The prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number. The application then prompts the user to confirm if they would like to include numbers, special characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters.The input is validated and at least one character type should be selected.

When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and will appear within the password box.
